Using Recursive-VF from Google fonts

    [font source: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Recursive:slnt,wght,CASL,CRSV,MONO@-15..0,300..1000,0..1,0..1,0..1]

Recursive-VF uses the letter "g" with a descending glyph
    [fonts-source: https://s3.amazonaws.com/benetta.net/fonts/recursive-woff2/Recursive-VF.ttf]

In contrast, Recursive-2019 has the target letter "g"
    [fonts-source: https://s3.amazonaws.com/benetta.net/fonts/recursive-woff2/recursive-2019_11_22-20_38.woff2]

Therefore, do not use Google Fonts Recursive
